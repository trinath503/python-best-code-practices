# Iterators are methods that iterate collections like lists, tuples, etc. Using an iterator method, we can loop through an object and return its elements.

# define a list
my_list = [4, 7, 0]

# create an iterator from the list
iterator = iter(my_list)

# get the first element of the iterator
print(next(iterator))  # prints 4

# get the second element of the iterator
print(next(iterator))  # prints 7

# get the third element of the iterator
print(next(iterator))  # prints 0

# Here, first we created an iterator from the list using the iter() method. And then used the next() function to retrieve the elements of the iterator in sequential order.

# When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, we will get the StopIteration Exception
