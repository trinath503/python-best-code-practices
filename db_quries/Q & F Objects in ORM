In Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), the `Q` object and `F` object are powerful tools for building complex database queries and working with model data. These objects enable you to create more advanced and flexible queries.

**1. `Q` Objects**:

The `Q` object allows you to create complex queries by combining multiple conditions using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). It is particularly useful for constructing dynamic queries based on user input.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `Q` object:

```python
from django.db.models import Q
from myapp.models import Product

# Get products that are either in category 'Electronics' or have a price less than 100
query = Q(category='Electronics') | Q(price__lt=100)
products = Product.objects.filter(query)

# You can also negate a condition
query = ~Q(category='Clothing')
non_clothing_products = Product.objects.filter(query)
```

In the example, we use the `Q` object to construct a query that retrieves products in the 'Electronics' category or with a price less than 100. We can also negate a condition to retrieve products that are not in the 'Clothing' category.

**2. `F` Objects**:

The `F` object allows you to reference fields on the model itself, enabling you to perform operations on database fields within the query.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `F` object:

```python
from django.db.models import F
from myapp.models import Product

# Update the price of all products by increasing it by 10%
Product.objects.update(price=F('price') * 1.10)

# Find products where the available quantity is less than the minimum quantity required
query = F('available_quantity') < F('min_quantity_required')
low_stock_products = Product.objects.filter(query)
```

In this example, we use the `F` object to increase the price of all products by 10% and to find products with low stock by comparing the available quantity to the minimum quantity required.

Both `Q` and `F` objects are powerful tools for building complex queries and making updates to database fields. They help you construct dynamic and flexible queries while keeping your code concise and efficient.
