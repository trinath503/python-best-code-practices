`select_related` and `prefetch_related` are two methods in Django for optimizing database queries by reducing the number of database hits when dealing with related objects.

**`select_related`**:

- `select_related` is used to optimize one-to-one and many-to-one relationships.
- It performs a SQL join to retrieve the related objects in the same query used to fetch the main object, thus reducing the number of database queries.
- It works by following the foreign key or one-to-one relationships defined in the model.
- It's suitable for cases where you know you'll be using the related objects and need to minimize database queries.

**`prefetch_related`**:

- `prefetch_related` is used to optimize many-to-many and reverse foreign key relationships.
- It performs a separate database query to retrieve the related objects and then associates them with the main object, reducing the number of queries but potentially retrieving more data.
- It's suitable for cases where you want to retrieve related objects efficiently without knowing in advance if you'll use them all.

Here's a code example to illustrate the difference between `select_related` and `prefetch_related`:

Suppose you have two models, `Author` and `Book`, with a many-to-one relationship from books to authors.

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

**Using `select_related`**:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Book

def select_related_view(request):
    books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()
    return render(request, 'books.html', {'books': books})
```

In the template (`books.html`), you can access the related author without causing additional database queries:

```html
{% for book in books %}
    {{ book.title }} by {{ book.author.name }}
{% endfor %}
```

**Using `prefetch_related`**:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Author

def prefetch_related_view(request):
    authors = Author.objects.prefetch_related('book_set').all()
    return render(request, 'authors.html', {'authors': authors})
```

In the template (`authors.html`), you can access the related books without causing additional database queries:

```html
{% for author in authors %}
    <h2>{{ author.name }}</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for book in author.book_set.all %}
            <li>{{ book.title }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endfor %}
```

In the `prefetch_related` example, we start by selecting all authors and prefetching their related books. This optimizes the many-to-many relationship between authors and books by performing fewer database queries.

In summary, `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are used to optimize different types of database relationships in Django. Use `select_related` for one-to-one and many-to-one relationships, and use `prefetch_related` for many-to-many and reverse foreign key relationships.
